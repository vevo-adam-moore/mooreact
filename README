mooreact

a combination of two tutorials:

-React and Webpack: http://jslog.com/2014/10/02/react-with-webpack-part-1/

-Official intro tutorial: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

I was able to complete the first, then extend it to the second, and bring that to the very last step, where I hit a snag calling the comments.json via POST. The second tutorial gives an example server.js that handles the POST call, but I am using the webpack-dev-server. It only has default settings. I'm trying to figure out how to define this response for a POST call on that route without a regular node server file.
